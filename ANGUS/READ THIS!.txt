ANGUS' FAN ROTATES FORWARD BUT THE UV SHIELD MUST BE MOVED IN SOME WAY 
AS THE FAN CANNOT PUT OUT THE CANDLE AT A DISTANCE OF 3 inches or greater 4/12/12

To test the accuracy of ANGUS' odometry sensor I have set up a debug statement that shows the ScootDistance being counted down in the Scoot subroutine. 

Scoot:
  LeftSpeed =  FORWARD_LEFT_FAST
  RightSpeed =  FORWARD_RIGHT_FAST
Scoot1:
  GOSUB SetMotorSpeed
Scoot2:
  GOSUB CheckOdometry
  DO UNTIL ScootDistance = 0
  DEBUG DEC ScootDistance,CR   <----DEBUG STATEMENT!
    Temp = WhiteLine
    GOSUB CheckOdometry
    IF Temp <> WhiteLine THEN ScootDistance = ScootDistance -1
  LOOP
  GOSUB FullStop
  RETURN

When ANGUS is running under the following test program, the debug terminal will count down from 80 to 0 at the FAST motor speed.

  ScootDistance = 80
  GOSUB Scoot
  STOP

However if ANGUS is running with the SLOW motor speed the debug terminal will count down from 70 to 0 even though the ScootDistance is defined as 80.

  Leftspeed = FORWARD_LEFT_SLOW
  Rightspeed = FORWARD_RIGHT_SLOW
  ScootDistance = 80
  GOSUB Scoot1
  STOP

What could be the problem? Is there something wrong with my coding?

Mr.Pinette has an presented me with a test for the odeometery inacurracy. 
	1. Get a very long piece of paper (about 2-3 ft)
	2. Test Angus with odometry at both FAST and SLOW speeds. 
	3. Measure the distance of travel after each test
	4. If the distances are siginificantly different then we have a hidden coding error. 
About 20 tests for each speed.

Angus' fan has stopped working. It will power on in the test program but only for a split second then it repeats. 
TESTS:
1.Disconnect the fan completely and see if Angus'operation improves. 
2. Check voltage in PIN15 screw terminals to see if how much power (if any) is going to the fan and resistor in the test program.
